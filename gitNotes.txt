two ways to use : Github Desktop
by using commands

for which GitBash is required
more like command Line interface

System cmd dont recognise github commands
git init ---->initialise empty local repository

git add .   ---->everything will be selected and add is for commiting file
git commit -m "initial comit"


to link these files
git remote add origin "http.."


to push code
git push origin branchName 
Master is our default branch
git push origin master
  
local and remote accounts must be same.

git clone
    git clone link (link of that repository)

we have to manually install node modules folder manually
npm install


to give access
settings->manage access->add user name
